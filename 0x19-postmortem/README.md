As our systems grow in scale and complexity, occasional failures are inevitable. These failures should be viewed not as setbacks but as opportunities for growth. They offer a chance to:

Identify and address vulnerabilities within our system.
Prevent repeat incidents and reduce Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR).
Unite teams in planning and preparation for future challenges.
An incident postmortem, or post-incident review, is the most effective way to dissect an incident. It allows us to understand:

Why the incident occurred.
The impact it had.
The actions taken to mitigate and resolve the issue.
The steps necessary to prevent future occurrences.
An incident postmortem serves as a framework for learning and turning challenges into opportunities for improvement. It fosters trust among customers, colleagues, and end users, demonstrating that the team is actively working to minimize the likelihood and impact of future incidents.
